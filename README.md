# Lana Duke Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, technical background, and interests at the intersection of computer science, data, and financial systems.

I recently graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in Computer Science, concentrating in AI and Information Networks. My work spans applied machine learning, data engineering, and full-stack development, with a particular focus on building systems that turn complex data into useful, well-designed products.

The site highlights a selection of my projects, including applied AI tools, data-driven platforms, and end-to-end engineering work, along with background on my technical skills and interests.
